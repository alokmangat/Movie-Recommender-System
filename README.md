# Movie Recommender System 🎬🍿

A Machine Learning based Movie Recommendation System built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Movie Recommender System** is designed to suggest movies to users based on patterns in movie ratings and preferences. Recommendation systems are widely used in online services like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube to provide personalized suggestions and improve user engagement. These systems use algorithms such as **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** to analyze user history and movie features to generate relevant recommendations. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

In this project, the focus is on building and evaluating a recommendation engine that can suggest movies similar to those a user has liked before. Typical workflows include loading the movie dataset, preprocessing data, constructing similarity matrices (e.g., using cosine similarity), and generating a list of recommended movies. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
